The website was developed for the end of courses at the IT-Academy. 
The functionality of the site is based on the logic of adding recipes of steaks by the user, with the possibility of moderating them by the administrator.
There are technologies what I have used in the project: Python, Django, Jinja, SQLite, HTML, CSS, OOP.
